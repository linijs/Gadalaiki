 This website showcases the four seasons with weather
                            animations and responsive design. The site features
                            interactive animations that depict the different
                            weathers and climates of each season, including
                            rain, snow, and wind.

  As users click through different sections, they're
                            able to select each season, which automatically
                            adjusts the scene to that season's weather, and
                            atmosphere.

In addition, the responsive design ensures that the
                            site works on different devices, from smartphones to
                            tablets and desktop computers.
